PROPOSED SOLUTION
While Fleet Onwers aspire to achieve Net-Zero Emissions As Soon as Possible, they also have to take
into account Business Sustainability and the Increased Cost Associated with Achieving Net Zero Emissions.

We Offer a Fleet DeCarbonization Software and Mobile App for Ground Transportation Owners to be able
to schedule a DeCarbonization Routine to Enable them Achieve Net Zero Emissions.

Using the Software,Existing Fleet Owners are able to select the level of Net Zero Emissions Reduction
they can realistically achieve within a Decade or So.


The Software allows the Fleet Owner to:
1. Enter in the Years they Would Like to Plan for DeCarbonization of their Ground Fleet (1-10)
2. Enter the Number of Cars they Would Have in their Ground Transportation for the Given Year
3. Enter the Yearly Distance Demand for the Ground Fleet for Each Year
4. Select the Range of Decarbnoiation they Would Felel Comfortable Implementing for the Given Years:
 			 0%  - Lowest Operation Cost & Lowest Emission Reduction
  			100% - Highest Operation Cost & Highest Emission Reduction



The Software displays for the Fleet Owner:
1. The Required Cost to Achieve 0% Emission Reduction
2. The Required Cost to Achieve 100% Emission Reduction
3. The Required Cost to Achieve the Set Percentage Chosen By the Fleet Owner


This Solution allows the Fleet Owner to see
1. If they can realistically afford the Emission Reduction Threshold they have selected
2. If they can cost-wise afford to select a higher Emission Reduction Threshold
3. To know the cost associated with Maximum Emission Reduction for their Fleet

The Software allows Fleet Owners to Optimize FLeet Emission Reduction for their Fleet
Per Decade, taking into account:
1. Cost
2. Customer Demand and Satisfaction


PAST EXPERIENCE WITH CUSTOMERS
Olawuyi Racett Nigeria ltd. OX1 2JD, has worked on Optimizing Volume Measurements in the
Oil and Gas Industry.
We have Designed a Novel Innovative Method called PePVEAT that provides a technological
replacement for the Manual Tank-Dip Methods used in the Oil and Gas Industry to perform
Volume Measurements of Petroleum Products.


TECHNOLOGY STAGE
The Fleet Optimization Software owned by OLAWUYI RACETT NIGERIA LTD. OX1 2JD, is currently at
the level TRL 3 Stage.
This is because
1. We Have Fully developed the Mathematical and Sofware Algorithm to Calculate and Display 
the Maximum Emission Reduction and Cost, as well as the Minimum Emission Reduction and Cost for a User-Defined Number of Years, Fleet Size,
and Distance Demand.

DECARBONIZATION ANALYSIS PER DECADE
For (N=1; N <= 10; N++):
{
   Car_Cost_Per_Year_for_Available_Cars = Car_Purchase_Cost + Insurance_Cost + Maintenance_Cost
   Car_Operation_Cost_Demand_Per_Year_for_Available_Cars = Distance_Demand_Per_Year * Fuel_Consumption * Cost_Per_Unit_Fuel 
   Car_CO2_Emission_Per_Year_for_Available_Cars = Distance_Demand_Per_Year * CO2_Emissions_Per_Unit_Fuel * 

   Lowest_Car_Cost_Per_Year = Min(Car_Cost_Per_Year_for_Available_Cars + Car_Operation_Cost_Per_Year_for_Available_Cars)
   Highest_Car_cost_Per_Year = Max(Car_Cost_Per_Year_for_Available_Cars + Car_Operation_Cost_Demand_Per_Year_for_Available_Cars)

   Highest_Emission_Reduction_Per_Year = Min(Car_CO2_Emission_Per_Year_for_Available_Cars)
   Lowest_Emission_Reduction_Per_Year = Max(Car_CO2_Emission_Per_Year_for_Available_Cars)

   Lowest_DeCarbonization = Lowest_Emission_Reduction_Per_Year (0%)
   Highest_DeCarbonization = Highest_Emission_Reduction_Per_Year (100%)

   Fleet_Owner_DeCarbonization_Scale_Selection = x

   Therefore,
   Fleet_Owner_Car_Cost_Per_Year = (x/100) * Highest_Car_Cost_Per_Year
   Fleet_Owner_Emission_Reduction_Per_Year = (x/100) * Highest_DeCarbonization

}

  ALGORITHMS TO BE LEVERAGED
- LONG-TERM PLANING, ANALYSIS AND OPTIMIZATION (A DECADE AT A TIME)
- LINEAR RELATIOSHIP BETWEEN COST OF DECARBONIZATION AND REDUCTION OF CARBON EMISSION
- SELECTION OF OPTIMIZED DECARBONIZATION THRESHOLD USING A CUSTOM-DESIGNED DECARBONIZATION SCALE


FACTORS IN CONSIDERATION FOR SOLUTION
1. FLEET DATA FROM REPUTABLE SOURCES INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING:
	A. A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF THE TYPES AND SIZES OF VEHICLES IN FLEET
	B. THE FUEL CONSUMPTOIN PER KM TRAVELLED FOR EACH VEHICLE
	C. THE UNIT COST OF ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUEL AVAILABLE 
	D. THE CO2 EMISSION DATA FOR EACH TYPE OF FUEL AVAILABLE

NOVELTY

DECARBONIZATION IS NOT NECESSARILY ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUE GENERATION.
IN FACT, IT TENDS TO BE THE OPPOSITE IN THE SHORT RUN, AND SO PRODUCTS
PRODUCED FOR DECARBONIZATION TEND TO NOT GENERATE INCOME OR REVENUE IN
THE SHORT RUN.
WHILE DECARBONIZATION PRODUCTS MAY HAVE A LOT OF MERIT IN TERMS OF
TECHNICAL VALUE, THEY RARELY GENERATE PROFIT.
BY PROVIDING A DECARBONIZATION SOFTWARE THAT IS CHEAP AND READILY 
AVAILABLE, IT WOULD INSPIRE OPERATIONAL FLEETS TO GO THE EXTRA MILE
AND SPEND A LITTLE MORE IN OPERATIONAL COSTS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE
AN INCREASE IN CARBON EMISSION REDUCTIONS.

COMPETITORS AND MARKET SIZE
- CURRENT/FUTURE COMPETITORS - NONE
TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET (TAM)
SERVICEABLE ADDRESSBLE MARKET (SAM)
SERVICEABLE OBTAINABLE MARKET (SOM)
* GROUND FLEET TRANSPORTERS. THIS WILL INCLUDE CAR RENTAL AGENCIES
  TAXI FLEETS, OIL AND GAS TANKERS TRANSPORTATION FLEETS, 
  FLEETS OF METRO BUSES.

EVERY OWNER OF A FLEET ON THE GROUND HAS NEED OF THE DECARBONIZATION 
SOFTWARE TO HELP THEM PLAN FOR THE DECARBONIZATION ROUTE BEST FEASIBLE
FOR HIS OR HER OWN COMPANY FLEET, AND TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO EXECUTE
CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION ON THE GROUND.



OUR SOFTWARE ENABLES LONG-TERM PLANING FOR DECARBONIZATION SCHEDULES BY
OPERATIONAL FLEETS AND TRANSCENDS TO LONG-TERM COMMITTMENT TO DECARBONIZATION
AND MEETING NET-ZERO EMISSIONS OPTIMIALLY IN THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME.




INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
WE DO NOT YET HAVE A PATENT FOR THE DECARBONIZATION SOFTWARE,
BUT AS WE FULLY DEVELOP IT IN COLLABORATION WITH SHELL, WE EXPECT AND HOPE
THAT SHELL WOULD ASSIST US IN SECURING THE RIGHT PATENT FOR IT AS WE WORK 
WITH THEM.

QUESTIONS
1. How many cars can i buy each year? Is there a limit to it?
Can I purchase more than 1 unit of the same Car ID E.g, 
Can I purchase 3 BEV_S1_2023 in the year 2023 (at the beginning)?



We want to and are designing a Fleet DeCarbonization Software that will allow 
companies with Ground Transportation to:
1. Enter in the Years they Would Like to Plan for DeCarbonization of their Ground Fleet
2. Enter in the Yearly Demand for their Ground Transportation
3. The Number of Cars they Would Have in their Ground Transportation for the Given Year
4. Select the Range of Decarbnoi\ation they Would Felel Xomfortable Implementing for the Given Years.
  Our Company Has a DeCarbonization Range that Spans from 0 to 100%
  with 0% Resulting in Lowest DeCarbnoization Fleet Cost and Minimum Fleet Emission Reduction
  while 100% Results in Highest DeCarbonization Flee Cost and Maximimum Fleet Emission Reduction.

The Company Owner is free to choose any DeCarbonization Fleet Percentage between 0 and 100%.
For Any Range Chosen by the DeCarbonizatio fleet Owner, the Software will provide
the Yearly Cost of Running the Ground Transportation Fleet, and the Expected Fleet Emission
Reduction
